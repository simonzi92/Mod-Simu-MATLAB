# MATLAB Fall 2014 â€“ Research Plan

> * Group Name: Game Theory Players
> * Group participants names: Fabian Keller, Sebastian Klotz, Simon Zimmermann
> * Project Title: Sequential Investment Game

## General Introduction
The sequential investment game problem is one of the basic problems in game theory. There is already a solution given by Kelly in 1956 which solves the problem for one player. In our project we want to expand the problem to a finite number of players.
There are different applications of game theory in information science, economics etc. 
We don't already know the specific inital conditions and boundaries for our case, but we are going to meet Prof. Murphy, which is the Game Theory Professor at ETH. We hope to get some additional information from him to define the goals of this project.


## The Model

We don't already know the specific inital conditions and boundaries for our case, but we are going to meet Prof. Murphy, which is the Game Theory Professor at ETH. We hope to get some additional information from him to define the goals of this project.


## Fundamental Questions

We don't already know the specific inital conditions and boundaries for our case, but we are going to meet Prof. Murphy, which is the Game Theory Professor at ETH. We hope to get some additional information from him to define the goals of this project.


## Expected Results

Our problem can not be solved by a closed form solution, so we are going to simulate different cases with different parameters.

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

Maybe Prof. Murphy will give us some additional papers of data sets.

We will update this form after the meeting with Prof. Murphy.
